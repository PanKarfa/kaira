"""Composite loss module for combining multiple loss functions.

This module provides functionality to create composite losses that combine
multiple individual loss functions with customizable weights. This is particularly
useful for cases where training requires optimizing multiple objectives
simultaneously, such as reconstruction loss combined with adversarial loss
or perceptual loss.

The composite approach addresses several common challenges in training:
- Different losses capture different aspects of the desired output
- Some applications require balancing multiple objectives
- Custom training schemes may need to emphasize certain properties over others

class CompositeLoss(BaseLoss):
    """A loss that combines multiple loss functions with optional weighting.

    This class allows for the creation of custom loss functions by combining
    multiple individual losses with specified weights. It's useful when training
    requires optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, such as combining
    pixel-wise reconstruction loss with perceptual or adversarial losses.

    The composite approach can balance the trade-offs between different loss terms.
    For example, L1 loss promotes pixel accuracy, while perceptual loss promotes
    visual quality. By combining them, you can achieve outputs that satisfy
    multiple criteria.

    Example:
        >>> from kaira.losses import L1Loss, SSIMLoss, PerceptualLoss
        >>> from kaira.losses.composite import CompositeLoss
        >>>
        >>> # Create individual losses
        >>> l1_loss = L1Loss()
        >>> ssim_loss = SSIMLoss()
        >>> perceptual_loss = PerceptualLoss()
        >>>
        >>> # Create a composite loss with custom weights
        >>> losses = {"l1": l1_loss, "ssim": ssim_loss, "perceptual": perceptual_loss}
        >>> weights = {"l1": 1.0, "ssim": 0.5, "perceptual": 0.1}
        >>> composite_loss = CompositeLoss(losses=losses, weights=weights)
        >>>
        >>> # Train a model with the composite loss
        >>> output = model(input_data)
        >>> loss = composite_loss(output, target)
        >>> loss.backward()
        >>> optimizer.step()
