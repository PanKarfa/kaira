Kaira is an open-source simulation toolkit for communications research
built on PyTorch. It provides a modular, user-friendly platform for
developing, testing, and benchmarking advanced communications
algorithms---including deep learning-based approaches such as deep joint
source-channel coding (DeepJSCC). Designed to accelerate research and
innovation, Kaira integrates seamlessly with existing PyTorch projects,
supporting rapid prototyping of novel communication strategies.
