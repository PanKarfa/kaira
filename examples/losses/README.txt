Loss Functions
==============

This directory contains examples demonstrating the various loss functions available in Kaira
for training deep learning models. The examples cover:

- Image losses (MSE, LPIPS, SSIM)
- Audio losses (STFT, MelSpectrogram)
- Text losses (CrossEntropy, LabelSmoothing)
- Multimodal losses (Contrastive, Triplet, InfoNCE)
- Adversarial losses (VanillaGAN, WGAN)

Each example illustrates:
- The mathematical formulation and intuition behind each loss
- Practical usage scenarios and best practices
- Visualizations of loss behavior 
- Parameter tuning considerations
- Comparisons between related losses
