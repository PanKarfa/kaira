Data Generation and Correlation Models
======================================

These examples demonstrate how to use data generation utilities and correlation models in the Kaira library.

Data generation and correlation models are essential components in information theory and communications
for creating synthetic datasets, simulating source coding scenarios, and modeling statistical dependencies
between information sources.

Key Concepts
------------

* **Binary Sources**: Generation of random binary sequences with specified probabilities
* **Uniform Sources**: Creation of continuous-valued data with uniform distribution
* **Correlation Models**: Statistical dependencies between multiple data sources
