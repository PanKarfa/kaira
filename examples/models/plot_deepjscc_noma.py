# Comparing NOMA with Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""
Key advantages of DeepJSCC-NOMA over traditional approaches:

1. Spectral Efficiency: NOMA allows multiple users to share the same time-frequency 
   resources, improving overall spectral efficiency compared to OMA.

2. User Fairness: Power allocation coefficients can be adjusted to balance 
   quality of service between users with different channel conditions.

3. Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC): The decoder uses SIC to 
   extract user signals sequentially, starting with the strongest user signal.

4. Graceful Degradation: As SNR decreases, all users experience quality 
   reduction gracefully instead of some users losing connection entirely.

# Conclusion
# --------------------
# This example demonstrated how to use the DeepJSCC-NOMA model for multi-user image
# transmission at a fixed SNR, focusing on the impact of power allocation.
# Key insights include:
#
# 1. NOMA enables efficient sharing of channel resources among multiple users.
# 2. Power allocation between users directly affects individual quality and can be
#    adjusted based on priority or channel conditions, as shown in the plot above.
# 3. Successive interference cancellation enables extraction of overlapping signals.
#
# Applications include:
# - Dense wireless networks with many simultaneous users
# - IoT scenarios with diverse device capabilities
# - Surveillance systems with multiple cameras sharing bandwidth
# - Multimedia broadcast services with users at different distances/conditions

# Display any remaining plots if running interactively
