Communication Models Gallery
===================================

This gallery contains examples of various communication models implemented in Kaira.
The examples demonstrate how to configure, use, and evaluate different model types for
tasks like:

* Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (DeepJSCC)
* Channel coding with modulation
* Multiple access communication
* Wyner-Ziv coding with side information
* Feedback channel communication
* Binary transcoding
* Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)
* And more...

These examples showcase how to build end-to-end communication systems with Kaira's
flexible model architecture.
