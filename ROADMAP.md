# Kaira Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development trajectory for Kaira. Note that this roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and emerging research directions.

## Short-term Goals (Next 3-6 months)

### Core Functionality Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for more wireless channel models (e.g., frequency-selective fading, multi-antenna systems)
- [ ] Implement additional modulation schemes (e.g., OFDM, adaptive modulation)
- [ ] Expand support for hybrid analog-digital transmission techniques

### Metrics and Evaluation

- [x] Add more performance metrics for communication (e.g., bit error rate, spectral efficiency)
- [ ] Implement visualization tools for simulation results
- [ ] Create benchmark datasets and reference implementations for common tasks

### Documentation and Examples

- [x] Add detailed tutorials for common use cases
- [x] Expand API documentation with more examples
- [x] Create interactive notebooks demonstrating key features
- [x] Automatically generate README.md instead of README.rst. Remove README_template.
- [x] Include Inheritance Diagrams to the docs.
- [x] Change logo
