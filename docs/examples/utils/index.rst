Detailed Topics
---------------------

Capacity Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The capacity analysis example demonstrates techniques for evaluating channel capacity:

- Shannon capacity limits for different channel types
- Comparison of modulation schemes based on capacity
- MIMO capacity analysis with varying antenna configurations
- Capacity CDF for fading channels
- Energy efficiency analysis

Each example includes detailed explanations, interactive visualizations, and practical applications,
making it easier to understand and apply these utility functions in communication system research
and development.
