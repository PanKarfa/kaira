Introduction
============

.. warning::
   Kaira is currently in beta. The API is subject to change as we refine the library based on user feedback and evolving research needs.

Kaira is an open-source simulation toolkit for communications research built on PyTorch. It provides a modular,
user-friendly platform for developing, testing, and benchmarking advanced communications algorithmsâ€”including
deep learning-based approaches such as deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC).

Key Features
------------

* **End-to-End Learning**: Design complete communication systems trainable from end to end
* **Channel Modeling**: Simulate various wireless channel conditions
* **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate system performance with industry-standard metrics
* **Extensible Architecture**: Easily customize and extend components for your specific needs

Getting Started
---------------

To start using Kaira, install it via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install kaira
